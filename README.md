INTRODUCTION
------------
Studiocracy is Reddit meets Etsy for local art.
We address the difficulty emerging artists have with getting their work
noticed by letting them bypass the gallery system and interact directly with
their community. Unlike other art retailers, we're a social network first and a 
marketplace second. We track user engagement through a community voting system and use
that data to help artists develop their careers and complete more sales without the
pressure of having to treat their studio like a business.

We have been tasked with creating an intuitive process for new users to register with
Studiocracy. The team will design the process from the point where the user clicks "Sign up"
to the point where the user has completed their account registration with an active profile.
The most important aspect of this process will be the portfolio generator for artists.
One of Studiocracy's key goals is to be a professional network for artists similar to LinkedIn.
To achieve this goal, all artists registered with Studiocracy must have an updated portfolio with 
relevant information by the time they complete their registration. The registrations team
will design the onboarding process, as well as implement and modify designs for the final
portfolio editor and view. Eventually, the portfolio generator will be able to dynamically
generate portfolios based on available information.
